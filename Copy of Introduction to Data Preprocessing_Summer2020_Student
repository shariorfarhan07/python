Data for any ML application is collected through some ‘sensors’. These sensors can be physical devices, instruments, software programs such as web crawlers, manual surveys, etc. Due to hardware malfunctions, software glitches, instrument failures, amd human errors, noise and erroneous information may creep in that can severely affect the performance of your model. Apart from **noise**, there are several **redundant information** that needs to be removed. For e.g. while predicting whether it rains tomorrow or not, age of the person is irrelevant. In terms of text processing, there are several stop words that may be redundant for the analysis. Lastly, there may be several **outliers** present in your data, due to the way data is collected that may need to be removed to improve the performance of the classifiers.\" \n","                                    \n","                                            -Shehroz Khan, ML Researcher, Postdoc @U of Toronto\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0YYIQ5CNcZx-"},"source":["Some Data Preprocessing Techniques:\n","\n","* Deleting duplicate and null values\n","* Imputation for missing values\n","* Handling Categorical Features\n","* Feature Normalization/Scaling\n","* Feature Engineering\n","* Feature Selection"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gZPvqZUPTfrH"},"source":["#importing necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0EvGojt9m-Yo"},"source":["#Removing Null values / Handling Missing data\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"40I_BWUeTfrS","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":435},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1598319245478,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":659,"user":{"displayName":"Tahsin Mostafa","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg2SZ4jNeuGk1Hnnu0hu3gFCpmK7zJumqa9mY8qTA=s64","userId":"05073853506761193893"}},"outputId":"35fdf12c-c1e6-462f-bb7e-cf87387556f9"},"source":["volunteer = pd.read_csv('/content/sample_data/volunteer_opportunities.csv')\n","volunteer.head(3)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>opportunity_id</th>\n","      <th>content_id</th>\n","      <th>vol_requests</th>\n","      <th>event_time</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>hits</th>\n","      <th>summary</th>\n","      <th>is_priority</th>\n","      <th>category_id</th>\n","      <th>category_desc</th>\n","      <th>amsl</th>\n","      <th>amsl_unit</th>\n","      <th>org_title</th>\n","      <th>org_content_id</th>\n","      <th>addresses_count</th>\n","      <th>locality</th>\n","      <th>region</th>\n","      <th>postalcode</th>\n","      <th>primary_loc</th>\n","      <th>display_url</th>\n","      <th>recurrence_type</th>\n","      <th>hours</th>\n","      <th>created_date</th>\n","      <th>last_modified_date</th>\n","      <th>start_date_date</th>\n","      <th>end_date_date</th>\n","      <th>status</th>\n","      <th>Latitude</th>\n","      <th>Longitude</th>\n","      <th>Community Board</th>\n","      <th>Community Council</th>\n","      <th>Census Tract</th>\n","      <th>BIN</th>\n","      <th>BBL</th>\n","      <th>NTA</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>4996</td>\n","      <td>37004</td>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Volunteers Needed For Rise Up &amp; Stay Put!
